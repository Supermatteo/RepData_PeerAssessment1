## Loading and preprocessing the data

``` {r, echo = TRUE}
setwd("C:\\Users\\Automation\\Documents\\R\\RepData_PeerAssessment1")
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
dataStep <- read.csv("activity.csv")

aggSum <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = dataStep, FUN = sum)
hist(aggSum$step, 53, main = "Steps per day", xlim = c(0,25000))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
``` {r, echo=TRUE}
meanStep <- mean(aggSum$step)
medianStep <- median(aggSum$step)
```
``` {r, echo=TRUE}
meanStep
medianStep
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
